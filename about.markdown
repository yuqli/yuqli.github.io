I am currently a software engineer working on 3D object detection problems in a Bay area self-driving car startup.

I have an MS in Data Science from New York University (2019) and a BSc (First Class) in Statistics from The University of Hong Kong (2015).

In a past life, I was a graduate student in sociology. [Here](https://hub.hku.hk/handle/10722/265323) is my M.Phil thesis (100+ pages) on Chinese students' views on the 2014 protest in Hong Kong - a city I feel deep fondness for.
