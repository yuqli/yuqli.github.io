Some small tools I have written to speed up 3D voxel processing with CUDA, or parsing and writing 3D mesh. 

# vox2dem
A CUDA accelerated C++ tool to extract digital elevation models (i.e. heightmaps) from building voxels. [link](https://github.com/yuqli/vox2dem)

# voxRefactor 
A CUDA accelerated C++ tool to dilate building voxels. [link](https://github.com/yuqli/voxRefactor)

# gml2obj
A Python tool to extract individual buildings from CityGML files. [link](https://github.com/yuqli/gml2obj)

(More messy code from course projects...)

# CUDA conv 
...with tiling and memory tricks on GPU. [link](https://github.com/yuqli/gpu-exercises/blob/master/conv3D.cu)
